Design and implement an application that reads a set of values in the range 1 to 100 from the user (assume the user will only put in integers, integer inputs outside of the range 1 - 100 are ignored as invalid). 
The user can enter as many integers as they like until they choose to stop. 
Then creates a chart showing how often the values appeared. 
The chart can be made in the console and look like the one in the text document attached. 
The chart must show how many values fell in the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and so on.
Please put the files for this in your Assignments folder  for unit 6.
