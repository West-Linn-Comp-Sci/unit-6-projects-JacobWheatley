Design and implement an application that will place a "battleship" (which takes up 3 spaces) on a 1 by 7 grid using arrays.  Then develop a second class that will run test your program.



Make sure you fill out the Planning document.  And write your pseudocode.  


You make work with a partner.  Choose that person wisely.  Please do not implement any packages or commands we have not gone over in class as other students will be viewing your code.


Possible Mod that we will eventually code


-Randomly place the battleship - DDONE
-User input for guess - DONE
