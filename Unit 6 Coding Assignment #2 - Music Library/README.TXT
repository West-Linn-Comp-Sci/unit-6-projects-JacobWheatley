Design and implement a program that can store the data of a personal music library. 
A standard music library consists of of 10 albums and keeps track of the total play time and number of song tracks in the library. 
The total number of albums in a library can be doubled by the user if desired. An album has a title and artist, a certain number of tracks, and the total play time of the album. 
A new music library does not have any albums associated with it so a user must be able to add and remove albums.

Use object oriented design strategies and include toString methods for any non-client classes. (
Remember: the goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of using arrays to store objects, it is possible to complete this assignment using ArrayLists but we will only be using arrays in this assignment.)
